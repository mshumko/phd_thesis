\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{conclusions}
\textcolor{blue}{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Microburst scattering mechanism and relation to prior work
\item Microburst sizes and the elliptical shape, mention the curtain-microburst ambiguity.
\item In future work mention how curtains should be studied and outline that project. Mention the SAA and amplitude idea.
\item Mention REAL and how it plans to look at the microburst flux in PA space.
\item Mention BOOMS and how it plans to image microbursts to determine their shape without ambiguity.
\end{enumerate}
