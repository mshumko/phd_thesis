\chapter{Introduction}\label{CH:introduction}
Above Earth's atmosphere are the Van Allen radiation belts, a complex and dynamic plasma environment that can effect our technology-driven society. These effects include: a higher radiation dose for astronauts and cosmonauts, higher chance of spacecraft failure due to single event upsets that can lead to catastrophic latchups, cumulative degradation of silicon (changing the silicon doping) from an extended radiation dose that can degrade a transition to the point where it no longer function as a switch, and the degradation of the ozone layer due to the chemical production of NOX and HOX. With these effects in mind, it is no surprise that the radiation belts have been extensively studied since their discovery in the 1960s.

A topic of interest in the space physics community is wave-particle intersections that as we will see later in the introduction, can accelerate particles and scatter them into the atmosphere.

The goal of this dissertation is to study the wave-particle mechanism that scatters microbursts into Earth's atmosphere. This goal will be achieved by first introducing single charged particle motion in electric and magnetic fields, the major particle populations and how they couple in the magnetosphere, and then describe the history and current state of the fields relating to microbursts and wave-particle scattering

\section{Charged Particle Motion in Electric and Magnetic Fields}\label{Intro:particle_motion}
A charged particle trapped in the magnetosphere will experience three types of periodic motion in Earth's nearly dipolar field. The three motions are ultimately due to the Lorentz force that a particle of momentum $\vec{p}$, charge $q$, and velocity $\vec{v}$ experiences in an electric field $\vec{E}$ and magnetic field $\vec{B}$ and is given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}).
\end{equation} In the magnetosphere, the three periodic motions in decreasing frequency are gyration, bounce, and drift and each of these motions have a corresponding conserved quantity i.e. an adiabatic invariant. 

The highest frequency periodic motion is on the order of a kHz in the magnetosphere and is gyration about a magnetic field of magnitude $B$. This motion is circular with a Larmor radius of 
\begin{equation}
r = \frac{m v_\perp}{|q| B}
\end{equation} where $m$ is the mass and $v_\perp$ the particle velocity perpendicular to $\vec{B}$. This motion has a corresponding gyrofrequency 
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \frac{|q| B}{m}
\end{equation} in units of radians/second. The corresponding adiabatic invariant can be found by integrating the particle's canonical momentum around the particle's path
\begin{equation}
J_i = \oint (\vec{p} + q \vec{A}) \cdot d\vec{l}
\end{equation} where $J_i$ is the $i^{th}$ adiabatic invariant and $\vec{A}$ is the magnetic vector potential. This integral is carried out by integrating the first term over the circumference of the gyro orbit and integrating the second term using Stokes theorem to calculate the magnetic flux enclosed by the gyro orbit that results in $J_1 \sim v_\perp^2 / B$. $J_1$ is conserved as long as a driving force on the particle has a frequency much less than $\Omega$.

The second highest frequency periodic motion is the bounce motion that is due to a gradient in $\vec{B}$ that is parallel to $\vec{B}$. This motion naturally arises in the magnetosphere because the Earth's magnetic field is stronger near the poles, and artificially in the laboratory in magnetic bottle machines. This motion can be visualized \textcolor{red}{Include plots from 1997 Tsurutani SOME BASIC CONCEPTS INTERACTIONS OF WAVE PARTICLE IN COLLISIONLESS PLASMAS}

%This can be visualized as the particle exhibits helical motion around a magnetic field with some parallel velocity $\v_{||}$.

\textcolor{red}{In the presence of an electric field, $\vec{E}$, the particle will gyrate about its gyro center and the gyrocenter will drift due to the $\vec{E} \times \vec{B}$ drift.}

\section{Radiation Belts}\label{Intro:radiation_belt}
The Van Allen radiation belts were discovered by \citet{Allen1959} and \citet{Vernov1960} during the Cold War.

\section{Scope of Reserach}\label{Intro:scope}
This dissertation furthers our understanding of the microburst scattering mechanism and is organized into the following chapters. Chapter \textcolor{red}{X} will describe the spacecraft missions used to study microburst precipitation and wave-particle scattering. Then Ch. \textcolor{red}{Y} will describe a microburst scattering event observed by NASA's Van Allen Probes and the quasi-linear diffusion model that was developed. Next, Ch. \textcolor{red}{Z} will describe a bouncing packet microburst observation made by MSU's FIREBIRD-II mission where the microburst's lower bound longitudinal and latitudinal scale sizes were estimated. Chapter \textcolor{red}{ZZ} then expands the case study result from Ch. \textcolor{red}{Z} to a statistical study of microburst sizes and the microburst size models developed to interpret the data. Lastly, \textcolor{red}{ZZZ} will summarize the dissertation work and make concluding remarks about research to be done.
